# Vehicle-To-Vehicle-using-ESPNOW-V2V-
Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) project leverages the ESP-NOW protocol to implement critical safety and traffic management features. We employed RTOS (Real-Time Operating System) to ensure precise timing and reliability. 

Key features include:
Collision Detection and Avoidance
Lane Change Detection
Intersection Movement Assistance
Left/Right Turn Assistance
Traffic Management
Potential for Self-Driving Vehicle Integration.

 
Espressif ESP microcontrollers communicate seamlessly using the ESP-NOW protocol. 

Data transmitted includes:
Vehicle Speed
Vehicle Movement
Vehicle Angle
Exact Vehicle Location.

Vehicle-to-Vehicle communication holds immense potential to transform driving safety and traffic efficiency. While challenges remain, advancements in this field will revolutionize transportation. Our project demonstrates the power of V2V in a real-world context, paving the way for a future of connected, intelligent vehicles.Vehicle-to-Vehicle (
